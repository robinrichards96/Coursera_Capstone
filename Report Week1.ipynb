It's therefore important that anyone wishing to develop commercially on land in London is adequately equipped with the right data and the right analysis.\n",

The Westfield shopping centre in Shepherds Bush cost Â£1.7 billion to construct, this shows the scale of the investments that companies are willing to put into these projects. It is therefore paramount that they have sufficient data and projections to base these investments on."

This will form the basis for my recommendations."
